# Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Data with Python

## Overview
This project aims to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on transactional data from an online retail store. By analyzing this data, we aim to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products, ultimately assisting in making key business decisions.

## Project Scenario
As an entry-level data analyst at an online retail company, we are tasked with analyzing transactional data. This dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Our goal is to explore and analyze this dataset to uncover patterns, outliers, and correlations, which will help in making data-driven decisions to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Objectives
- Describe data to answer key questions and uncover insights.
- Gain valuable insights to improve online retail performance.
- Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.

## Your Challenge
Your challenge in this project is to perform exploratory data analysis to make informed business decisions. This involves loading, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing the data. Additionally, you'll pose meaningful questions and seek answers using the provided dataset.

## Dataset
We'll be using a dataset containing all transactions that occurred between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. This dataset provides a wealth of information that will allow us to extract valuable insights.
